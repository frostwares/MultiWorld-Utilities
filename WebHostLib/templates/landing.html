                <p>This is a <span data-tooltip="Allegedly.">randomizer</span> for The Legend of Zelda: A
                    Link to the Past.</p>
                <p>This is also a multiworld, meaning your items may be placed into other players' worlds, and
                    other players's items may be placed into your world. When a player picks up an item which does
                    not belong to them, it is sent back to the player it belongs to over the internet.</p>
                <p>This website allows you to host a multiworld game, and provides item and location trackers for all
                    games hosted here.</p>
                <p>Currently, a locally installed client is required to play. This client should handle patching
                    your ROM files and connecting to the multiworld server. More information on how to set up a local
                    client may be found on the
                    <a href="{{ url_for("tutorial") }}">Setup Guide</a>.</p>
                <p>This website is under active development. As such, your hosted rooms may occasionally disappear,
                    and there may be bugs. If you do happen to find a bug, please report it
                    <a href="https://github.com/Berserker66/MultiWorld-Utilities/issues">here</a>.</p>
